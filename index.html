                <p> My name is Jiho John Kim. I am currently an aspiring web developer, even to my suprise.
                    I
                    graduated with a
                    Business Degree from UC Irvine. I had little to no exposure to coding in the past, but after careful
                    consideration, I decided that I really wanted a new challenge and enrolled in this Coding Bootcamp.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Although I am a Korean-American born in Los Angeles, I spent most of my life in Vietnam
                    and
                    Thailand. By living overseas, I got to have a very wide worldview and also learn to interact with
                    and respect many types of cultures. I think this helped me get a very different perspective comapred
                    to someome who lived in just one country their whole life. Seeing the hard lifestyle in countries
                    like Vietnam and Thailand inspired me to try and create things that can help out people in such
                    countries.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Through this Bootcamp, I hope to learn many new skills and continue to challenge myself
                    moving
                    forward..
                    I believe that working with technology in any shape or form is very important, and coding is one of
                    the
                    bestways to do so. My dream is to be able to create a product that will change many lives.</p>
