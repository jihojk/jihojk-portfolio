        <p> My name is Jiho John Kim. I am currently an aspiring web developer, even to my suprise. I graduated with a
            Business Degree from UC Irvine, and even I could not have seen myself learning to code and become a
            developer. </p>
        <p> Although I am a Korean-American born in Los Angeles, I spent most of my life in Vietnam and Thailand. I
            believe that living outside of the U.S has given me a unique view on the world and more senstivie to
            different cultures than most people.
            <p> Through this Bootcamp, I hope to learn many new skills and continue to challenge myself moving forward..
                I believe that working with technology in any shape or form is very important, and coding is one of the
                premier ways to do so. My dream is to be able to create a product that will change many lives.</p>
